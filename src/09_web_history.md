# Web History and Background


Web-development has evolved a fair amount from the early 90s, where HTML 1.0. We have gone from only developing static web pages, styling and early javascript engines and more dynamic content.

## The Incorrect History Of The Web

The history of web can be roughly (and likely incorrectly) listed as:

Within early web-technologies

* Static HTML Pages            - 90s
* Cascading Styling Sheets     - 90s
* Javascript                   - 90s
* Server-Side Rendering        - 90s

This was a dominated by languages like PHP and Perl that were used for server side rendering.

During 2000s and early 2010s, websites and applications started adopting and technologies were developed further.

* Wider use of AJAX            - 00s
* CMS (Wordpress, Drupal)      - 00s
* Mobile Web                   - 00s
* Web API - JSON standard      - 00s

Within the 2010s, single-page applications, APIs, Web-Assembly, Translations from JS to Platform Target and newer protocols like websockets and webrtc become standardised.

* Single Page Applications     - 10s
* Server-Side JS               - 10s
* New Protocols (WebSockets)   - 10s
* JS to Native Apps            - 10s

Even to this day some of the technologies such as WASM are still being settled into the regular development flow. Regardless, all these different tools and technologies still exist in some form today and will likely continue to work for another decade.

Or maybe a week later, who knows.
