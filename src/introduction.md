# Programming 1

Welcome to *Programming 1* with **Javascript** using NodeJS and the Web Browser. This series, while being continually developed is give the reader the resources and ability to develop capabilities over this book.

The aim of this book is to guide your learning and journey.

## Who is it for and why?

Like many who have started a journey in learning to program, you have stumbled on some resource that offers a path.

This is path for those who:

* Want to make things with code
* Like solving problems
* Desire to understand how their computer works
* To interact with their computer beyond their GUI

The goal of this book is to empower the reader and enable them to build a variety of applications and programs.

## Reading this book

There are different reading strategies that can be employed in this book. My own process is to read the chapter straight through and note down concepts that are unfamiliar to me that the author is trying to introduce.

By doing this, you have at least gained knowledge of what you don't know and will need to process and engage with.

Some useful notes though.

* Consider at least two passes, one quick pass and the other a more thorougher one

* If you find yourself stuck on a paragraph or passage, break the loop, this could be down to information density in which you may need to process through notetaking.

* Be able to resume from where you were left off. Book mark the page using the browser's capabilities or print pages so you can annotate them. Make it accessible for yourself.

## System Requirements

When starting to learn a programming language, you will need to access to a number of utilities that may be a little difference depending on your operating system and configuration.

Please be aware of the following things:

* What operating system you currently running, you could be using
  * Windows
  * MacOS
  * Linux
  * FreeBSD
  * Something else entirely!

* Hardware Architecture of your device, while it likely won't make a meaningful difference, being aware of it when setting up will help. You could be using
  * x86 (x86_64, AMD64)
  * ARM (aarch64)


* Access to a terminal/shell to execute code and commands. you could be using
  * zsh
  * bash
  * powershell

* Access to a web browser to execute code, you could be using
  * Firefox
  * Chrome
  * Safari

After reviewing the above and seeing if you meet at least one of each category, you can start.
