## Using documentation

The documentation above should be aptly categorised in what is relevant. While there is an infinite number of resources that can be used. This list has been curated based on its authority, domain and relevance.

In my own case, whenever I look up javascript standard library functions, MDN is the first one I go to. If I know it is a NodeJS specific feature, I will look at the NodeJS documentation.
