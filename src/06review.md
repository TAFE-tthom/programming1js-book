# Review

Callbacks are one of the most universal and power tools to add to your toolkit. We can see how they are used in a variety of scenarios such as sorting, mapping, input and output and networking.

* What you shopuld know and understand
  * How generalisations work for algorithms and why callbacks are useful
  * Different standard IO kinds'
  * Difference between files and buffers
  * Why async and callbacks overlap
  * Have a bit more insight into the execution model of javascript

* You should be able to apply
  * Construct a callback for an algorithm that has been generalised
  * Use async and await for IO operations as well as callbacks
  * Ensure that signatures match to the callback
  * Construct a recursive function andn reimplement its iterative variant
