# Review

Getting to this point is where you will have acheived all the necessary tools to start building even more complex programs. With more programming experience and identifying where it is best to create a function or object will enable your programs to be more readable for all programmers.

* What you should know and understand
  * Array initialisation and syntax
  * Object initialisation and fields
  * Reference semantics and how reference types work
  * Nesting of fields and objects within each other
  * Indirection and Aliasing concepts

* What you should be able to apply
  * Being able to initialise arrays and objects
  * Adding and removing elements from an array using built in methods
  * Specifying fields as part of initialisation of an object
  * Use parameters and return statements appropriately
  * Structure your program with functions appropriately

Arrays, Objects and Functions dominate how one will structure their program. They are not compulsory to use but they make organising data, logic and make it more readable.
