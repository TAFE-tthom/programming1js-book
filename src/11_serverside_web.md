# Server-side Web Development

We will be exploring server side web development in this section. After being able to run some simple servers with in the previous chapter, we will develop a server with greater capabilities and features.

This will explore understanding the HTTP protocol, utilities the examine and debug issues related to the protocol and conventional usage of it.

## Topics

The chapter will provide an overview and provides tooling to develop a server to respond to client requests and construct responses.

* Processes and server development
* HTTP Protocol, using netcat to examine the data
* HTTP Requests and Responses, http methods
* Using express to construct endpoints
* Persistance and Data Storage

Servers play an important role with the web, knowing how to host a website,  computing on a serverside and clientside is important for producing dynamic content.
