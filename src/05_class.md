# Classes and Methods

At this point in the book, you should have established the difference between primitive types, create functions and effectively use arrays, objects and control flow constructs. This chapter is a natural extension from the previous chapter where we combined functions and objects.

Prototypes and Classes are the combination of functions and objects. 

## Topic

This chapter explores the conventional object oriented programming concepts that were established in ES6 (EmcaScript 6). It will also ensure that previous ES5 constructs are demonstrated and mapped to the modern construction.

The chapter will explore the follow topic areas.

* Function Prototypes and Objects
* Class Structure and Construction
* Methods and Class Based Inheritance
* Modularising Code and Best Practices
* Import and Explort

This extension also combines and allows us to construct clear and readable templates.
