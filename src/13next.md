# What's Next?

You have reached the end of the book, where I do hope you have successfully completed your projects! I sincerely hope you feel like you have grown while working on each chapter and have learned something new about javascript along the way.

While your time with javascript will likely not end with this book you have reached what it can provide (for now).


However, there is always time to look towards another and a natural extension to Javascript is Typescript.


## Why typescript?

Reaching the point where you are able to develop programs which have many layers and moving parts.

You have observed with using some tooling to help with QA, this same tooling exists at a language leverl and can assist with writing a more robust application and reduce the surface areas of issues that can arise.


## Other extensions

While a programming language is a tool to explore computation, you should be at a point to explore other kinds of languages, tools and environments.

To help categorise for certain purposes.

For the **Web Developer**, explore other technologies

* More HTML and CSS
* CSS animations
* Accessibility
* Canvas element
* Capacitor and Progressive Web Apps
* SVG and Vector Graphics

For the **Game Developer**, look into the following.

* Canvas element
* WebGL and/or WebGPU
* WebAudio
* Publishing and packaging web applications as applications (Electron and Capacitor)


For the **Data Scientist**, look into the following.

* Python or R
* SQL.js
* MathJS
* Processing CSV, XLS and other data forats
* D3 for visualising data along with learning how SVGs work


For the **Embedded Systems Developer**, look into the following.

* Tessel and JerryScript
* Writing a virtual machine in Javascript, Instruction decoding and memory model
* WebSockets, WebRTC, WebSerial, WebMIDI, WebNFC and WebBluetooth


While I could go on, in general, it is best to just make more things and to have fun.
