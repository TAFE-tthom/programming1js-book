# Review

This is our first foray into using javascript to solve common problems. We have encountered brand new concepts and applied them against the exercises. Before continuing on to **Control Flow**, make sure you review and feel comfortable with the new concepts and topics today.

* What you should know and understand
  * What a source file is
  * How the source file relates to the `nodejs`
  * The relationship between text editor and source file
  * What a variable is and how it is used within a program
  * Different datatypes and the purpose of those data types
  * Different datatype literals
  * What different operators do and their relationship to the datatype and variable
  * The execution of program and how it steps through
  * Different kind of datatypes such as **primitive** and **reference** datatypes

* What you should be able to apply
  * Create programs using a text editor
  * Run your program using `node`
  * Declare and initialise variables
  * Use appropriate operators for solving a task
  * Pass command line arguments to a javascript program
  * Convert data types to another kind
  * Naming variables appropriately and to convention
  * Construct and solve problems outlined in the **Exercises** section

It isn't always the case where you need to know all of these completely and there may be some doubt with how much you understand and how well you understand it. You don't need to let that deter you from moving forward but at least note down questions you may have.

They may be in the next chapters.
