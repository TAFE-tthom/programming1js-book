# Review

Within this section you will have encountered some quirks and changes in the way you usually work. It can be difficult to break out of habits you have developed when solving problems and get use to doing things a different way but there can be an appreciation in the logic behind and methodology.

* What you know know and understand
  * How vite and react work together
  * What meta proramming is and what kind of role it plays
  * How JSX components interact with a parser
  * React components and the structure
  * Client side storage solutions


* What you should be able to apply and demonstrate
  * Build a simple application using react and html
  * Effectively use `useState`, `useEffect` and `useRef`
  * Combine these technologies with an external data source and backend server
  * Use the build system to construct a preview and use the linter

This way of developing web applications isn't necessarily the most optimal way but it is a conventional way. The positives it offers outweighs the negatives in many regards.
