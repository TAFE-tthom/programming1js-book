# Review

Data structures are a major moment for programmers. Building linked lists, stacks and queues reveals the mechanics of memory and how reference types work.

* What you should know and understand
  * How references work and how it relates to aliasing mentioned earlier
  * Implementing traversals for a linked list and other linked data structures
  * Understand pseudo-code
  * Different sorting and searching algorithms

* What you shoule be able to apply
  * Build a linked data structure such as a linked list
  * Implement a variation of a linked data structure such as a stack or queue
  * Implementing a sorting algorithm
  * Implementing a searching algorithm

These are major hurdles to overcome and will allow you to look at problems different going forward.
