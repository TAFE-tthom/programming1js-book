# Preparation

Prior to starting, it is advised you also have the following.

* Notebook
* Pen/Pencil
* Time Keeping Device - (Watch, Phone)
* Planner - (Calendar, Journal)

The utility of the above is to incorporate healthy learning habits by using the equipment above for their suitable purposes.

## Constructing Solutions - Notebook

Writing code is mostly the act of putting an idea onto paper. These ideas are ones in which we need to process and visualise.

The **Notebook** is a powerful tool here!

Examples:

* Using squares and lines to represent the relationship between objects in code.

* Writing out the steps of an algorithm you are designing and then implementing it.

* Showing the relationship between function calls.

* Creating notes and a summary of the task at hand and what to focus on.

* A deconstruction of the problem into smaller pieces.


The above examples are skills you will need to develop to improve as a programmer and problem solver.

For your own self, it also helps to ease the cognitive load when you are constructing a solution. Any complex problem is going to require a lot of notes and information being accessible and there is going to be a limit on what you can memorise.

## Knowing what you have done - Journalling

In combination with the notebook, A journal helps keep track of what solutions you have tried, what you still are attempting to resolve and gives you a points of reflection.

Software projects can require us to take on different tasks at different points in time and remembering where we were at can be difficult.

Journaling what we have done and where we left off, gives us a way to return back to where we left something, what has been completed and the reasons why. It also provides accountability.


## Scheduling the problems - Planning

Small and large projects will have multiple parts to them. These aren't necessarily solvable within a day or even within a week or month.

Planning is crucial to ensure that you schedule tasks to work on a schedule.

Don't be afraid of shifting it and changing the schedule it does not need to be rigid or super strict but has to communicate what you are working on in a way that helps you understand when you get back to it.
