# Control Flow

We will look into a few different conditional and loop constructs here and the patterns that are associated with them. The following constructs within javascript will be explored.

* `if...else`
* `while`
* `for`
* `do...while`
* `{ }`

In addition the being able get our programs to make decisions or iterate we will relate to these core concepts.

* **Sequence**
* **Selection**
* **Iteration**

As these are critical building blocks for programs and building algorithms.

## Topics

The take away from this chapter is that you should understand the following and where to appropriately apply it:

* Variable lifetime
* `if`, `else` and `else if`
* `while`, `do...while` and `for`
* `{ }` usage and scope rules
* Boolean logic being utilised for control flow.
* Designing and implementing an algorithm

Where we left off was building simple programs that went through a **sequence** of instructions, we are now going to introduce `if-else` statements as part of **selection** and `while`, `do...while` and `for` as part of **iteration**.
