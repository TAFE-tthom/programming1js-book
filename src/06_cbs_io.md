# Callbacks, IO and Async

Within this topic we will be introducing a few interlinked concepts. Callbacks are a concept that underpins a lot practices and conventions within JS and JS development.

Taking a look at the `NodeJS` standard library, you will observe a significant portion of functions require a callback to be given to it. This is particularly apparently with IO related functions.


## Topics

While looking into callbacks and IO, we also need to contrast this with `async` and `await`.

* Callbacks and Closures
* Input and Output
* File Types, Reading and Writing
* Standard Input and File Buffers
* `fetch` and Serialisation

It is at this point, we will be going towards the web topics where javascript started and continues to live.
