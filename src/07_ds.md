# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

A critical component as part of your programming journey is learning **Data Structures**. This is one of the most foundational and core components to programming that any programmer must undertake.

To underpin, how foundational and core data structures are, this topic area is what enables you to building very trivial programs to substantially more complex programs.

## Topic

You will be going through the following areas as we will just be going through some basic data structures within this chapter.

* Abstract Data Type
* List Based Data Structure
* Sorting and Searching
* Linked-References and Weak-References

These will help components will help you build on your data structure knowledge and skills while assembling larger and more complex objects.
