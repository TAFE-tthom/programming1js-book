# If-Else and Scope Rules

Without our programs we want to provide paths or branches. This can be performed by using `if` statements. The `if` statement's role is to evaluate a boolean expression and execute the code within branch if it is true.

Below is structure of an `if-else` block.

```
if( boolean_expression ) {
  //If the boolean expression results in being true
} else {
  //If the expression is false
}
```

A good example here is simply comparing numbers.

```js

let x = 10;

if(x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is smaller or equal to 5");
}
```

You can nest if statements within other if statements and have multiple conditions with `else if(...)` after the first if statement.
