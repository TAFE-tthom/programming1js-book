# QA, Testing, Debugging and Profiling

We dive into the realm of software quality assurance. The role of software QA is to ensure that the program we have set out to design and development meets the criteria and functionality specified.

QA has a variety of roles to it, focusing on functions and programs adhering to a specification, automating compliance with that specification and enhancing the developer's toolkit to identify issues that arise.


## Topic

We will be covering the following topics, they can seem independent but they all apply to the QA/Testing space.

* Test Types with Blackbox and Whitebox Testing
* Unit Testing and IO Testing
* Code coverage tooling and understanding its utility
* Garbage Collection and how memory is allocated and deallocated

Without testing your code or having the tools to test it, you are at best to assume that it does not work.
