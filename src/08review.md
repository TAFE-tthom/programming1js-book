# Review

While there are no exercises for this section, hopefully this chapter has provided significant insight when developing quality code, debugging it and profiling. While this section could go in much further depth, have some idea what to look into allows one to explore the tooling and have an idea on certain behaviour that can be observed.


* You should know and understand
  * Different test types and their purpose
  * Using vitest and writing unit tests
  * Purpose of comparing data with actual and expected
  * Writing documentation and using jsdoc
  * Internals of the garbage collector, references and allocations
  * Just-In-Time compilation basics


When building applications and being mindful of these things can prompt a developer to start investigating these problems as they arise. While it isn't important always view things in terms of performance as correctness is important overall. When there is a demand to ensure that the feel of an application meets certain criteria, examining and profiling your application is important.
