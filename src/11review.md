This chapter covers the basics of one aspect of the web stack. It allows you to build a web server with persistent data storage for static and dynamic content.

* What you should know and understand
  * Basics of the HTTP protocol
  * Different HTTP methods and their role
  * Using tools check endpoints and accessing the data
  * The purpose of endpoints and structure of express
  * Port number and concept of routing
  * Serialising data and performing server side rendering

* What you should be able to apply
  * Create a simple server with express
  * Construct endpoints to handle JSON and serialised data
  * Have different endpoints that map to http methods
  * Create a link to a database that is able to store and retrieve data from
  * Retrieve data for specific users and ensure that it can maintain persistent data between client and server runs.


Server side programming is fundamental for web applications that require recording and rendering content based on user or external sources. You will be able to create websites which can be artists and their albums, doucment systems and intranets and so much more.

While it has not looked into authentication and login panels, you are not far from that feature and seeing how data is handled on the server side and recorded to the database gives you the tools to complete such a task.
