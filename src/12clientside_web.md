# Client-side Web Development

Within this section we will be using a framework to develop a web application. It is assumed that you will be using `React` but you are more than welcome to use `Preact` in its place.

The significance of using a client-side framework for web development stems from a number of places.

* Component oriented development
* Pervasiveness of React and components
* Structure and tooling to assist with building simple and complex applications

However, to note, there are some significant drawbacks too. When subscribing to a particular framework, you are also needing to comply and understand what the framework is doing.

* Performance can be significantly impacted by adding another layer
* Understanding how it works requires additional work
* Some features can be unintuitive to implement.

> **Author's Note:** The choice to use react comes from a practical view that a large number of projects are built using that framework.
>  There are other alternatives such as **Vue** or **Svelte** or even building using **Web Components**. 

## Topic

We will go through the following topic areas within this chapter.

* `vite` build system
* `react` framework for the web
* JSX, Components and metaprogramming
* React hooks and scenarios
* Client-side Storage solutions
* Render state and update triggers

The framing is to establish what is current practice of developing web application and exploring its capabilities and development perspective.
