# Arrays, Objects and Functions

After wrapping up control flow we are now going to dive into abstractions for aggregating and composing data. In addition, this chapter will go into functions and modularising code. 

You have likely seen these constructs earlier in some of the examples or by using the standard library functions.

## Topics

These topics are part of composing more complex types and organise out code effectively. Our aggregates constructs such as **Arrays** and **Objects** give us the ability to assemble more complex objects and functions allow us to make subprograms within our program.

To reiterate, we will go through the following topics.

* Arrays
* Objects
* Functions
* Paramters and Return Values
* Indirection and References
* Algorithms

Each topic addresses a limitation you may have already ran into while programming.
