# Review

As we end the chapter on the command line, we have started launching ourselves into gaining more control over the computer and programming. To conclude, you posess knowledge of this topic and be able to apply it.

Review the following and ensure you can produce some evidence in the form of **notes**, **annotations**, **programs**, **attempts** or some artifact that informs you if you meet its criteria.

* What you should know and understand
  * The shell on your device
  * Filesystem pathing, files and directories
  * Filesystem structure
  * Concepts of a program and process
  * What a command is and how it relates to a program
  * What command line arguments are
  * Understand the role `git` has in this document

* What you should be able to apply
  * Open a shell
  * Be able to run commands
  * Navigate the filesystem using some basic commands
  * Be able to run a javascript program using `node`
  * Pass appropriate command line arguments to commands
  <!-- * Be able to use `git` to clone the exercise repository -->


While it is always difficult to know the concepts completely, the more one does, the more you will gain from it.
