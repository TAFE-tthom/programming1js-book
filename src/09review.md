You have reached the end of the chapter and have started learning new technologies in combination with javascript. While most resources teach javascript after using HTML and CSS, this book does intentionally go the opposite way.

* You should know and understand
  * Basics of HTML and the different tags
  * Basics of styling a website using css and attributes
  * The purposes of different attribute types for data and accessibility
  * Different events and binding them with javascript
  * The combination of all the tools and how they interact


* You should be able to apply and demonstrate
  * Assembly and construct a basic HTML page
  * Be able to style a HTML page and use suitable rulesets and properties in your CSS
  * Be able to integrate javascript events as part of DOM elements and also load them dynamically

All these skills lead towards being able to design and develop a response website and application.
