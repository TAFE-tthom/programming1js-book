# Review

Classes are a power construct in a way where they encapsulate everything you have learnted prior under the same umbrella. They are an effective categorisation mechanism and clearly outline operations to the data that would work on them.

* What you should know and understand
  * Classes and types, how they relate to each other
  * Methods and their declaration and usage
  * The relationship between objects and classes
  * Difference between static and instance methods
  * Different field construction
  * Inheritance and type hierarchies

* What you should be able to apply
  * Constructing classes from a specification
  * Able to mutate the state of a class and know when to use methods and static methods
  * Appropriately name classes and compose them with others
  * Initialise and construct objects from classes
  * Create a type hierarchy using the `extends` keyword

As you can see now, we have built upon from another level of abstraction based on where we left off from the last chapter. We have a new way of organising data and logic.
