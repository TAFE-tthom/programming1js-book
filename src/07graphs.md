# Supplementary - Graphs

**This Section Is Currently a WIP**

Graphs are a collection of vertices and edges. We have a few different kind of graphs.

Each vertex within a graph is able to connect to other vertices via edges.

Edges have two points, a start and end which refer to vertices. These edges could loop to the same vertex.

* Directed Graphs
* Undirected Graphs
* Weighted Graphs
* Unweighted Graphs (or weights of 1)


## What is the significance with graphs?

As outlined with the scenarios prior, even seemingly simple applications are going to involve graphs. This is because what we end up modelling usually has indicates that entities have relations and each entity type is going to interact with another in some form. 

## Graph Terms and Scenarios

* Vertex, usually also called node
* Edge, which are either a vertex pair or contains more data that describes the connection.

Some scenarions where graphs are used.

* Airport Flights and connections
* Google maps, routing from one location to another
* A state machine where we want to know what state we are in and where we transition town
