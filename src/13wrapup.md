# Wrap Up

To finally conclude, ideally, review the chapters and resources available and challenge yourself.

This is a series currently 3 planned books. The second volume is **Programming 2 - Typescript** and the third volume is **Programming 3 - Rust**.

Currently the second volume is being developed and will be linked when it is appropriate.


* Keep challenging yourself with new problems
* It is okay to re-tread old problems and get faster at solving them
* If you continue to practice and make things you will improve
* Always remember to reflect on success and failure and what you could do next time

Have fun coding.
