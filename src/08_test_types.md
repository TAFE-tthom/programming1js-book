# Testing Types

We are going to look into two kinds of test types and a framework for testing.
## What is part of a test?

A test-case scenario is made of the following components.

* Methodology/Method
* Preconditions
* Postconditions
* Expectations

Each part serves a purpose for ensuring 

## Whitebox Testing
 
This is typically where we employ some unit testing software, to help analyse the internals of the system and test them independently. 

## Blackbox Testing

User centric testing, without knowledge of the internals, input is given and compared to match the output of the program. This is usually linked to your E2E testing, where you want to testing from one end and see if it reaches and meets the expectation at the other.
