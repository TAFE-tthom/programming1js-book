# Review

Another fundamental pillar is wrapped up. You have moved on now and have gained the abilities to incorporate selection and iteration within your code.

* What you should know and understand
  * Boolean values and expressions
  * Control flow and how it can change based on the values given
  * What an `if` statement is
  * What a branch is (related to `if`s and loops)
  * The different loop constructs `for`, `while` and `do...while`
  * What nested if statements look like.
  * Logical operators

* What you should be able to apply
  * Write boolean expressions for making decisions and loops
  * How to apply different logical operators and chain them
  * Use different data types within a boolean expression
  * Construct more complex programs that use multiple variables
  * Mutate variables in if statements and loops

Control flow is one of those concepts in which your understanding and skills will always continue to develop. You wll be able to shorten the if boolean expressions and flow after today with more practice and insight gained.
